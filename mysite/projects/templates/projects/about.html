                    <p id="elementText1">I am from Iowa, I graduated high school at Southeast Polk then joined the navy
                        instead of going to
                        college. in the navy
                        I gained skills in leadership, team building, communication, and most importantly I learned to
                        surround myself with
                        people wanting to improve themselves as well as others.

                    <p id="elementText1">
                        I was medically discharged and came back home to Iowa, from there I went to join the workforce.
                        I started with the
                        electricians trade school Tesdell electric, i stayed on for three more years and dew to lay offs
                        i left. Soon after
                        I
                        started working as an erosion control engineer at my uncle's company and gained more leadership
                        skills as well as
                        gained
                        more responsibility after I became a crew lead and driver.

                        Shortly after I got my CDL for work I bought a house, and more importantly I got my dog a blue
                        heeler named Sora. It
                        was
                        Thanks to Sora, I got a second date with my now wife. This got me thinking I needed to set an
                        example for my future
                        kids like all of the people who did the same for me. This led to my decision to join the best
                        immersive boot camp
                        around, General Assembly, to start my career as a software engineer.
